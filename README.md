# Karamoja-IP-Sylvia 
As food security becomes one important goals in sustaining Africa. Uganda is faced with food insecurity in an area called Karamoja, located in the north-eastern part of Uganda.  As data analysts, we are required to examine and analyse yield and population per sub-county as well as yield and population per district. After analysing  the seven districts: Kaabong, Abim, Kotido, Moroto, Amudat, Napak and Nakapiripirit in Karamoja and the 52 sub-counties, we are then to develop  new food security monitoring tool to support the decision-making of one of those NGOs active in Karamoja.
The business objective of this data report is to outline various findings from the yield and population tables that  will aid in developing a new food security monitoring tool to support the decision making of the NGO to improve food security. 
Currently NGOâ€™s in Karamoja are providing technical support in terms of farm inputs to farmers experiencing extremely low yield. However, in order to carry out their operations they lack visibility into the overall state of the region and often need to rely on some very local sources of information to prioritize their activities. Nevertheless, this approach can be improved as it can be tedious and unreliable.
The data mining goal for the project is to evaluate which districts and sub-counties should be prioritized in the technical support by the NGO so as to improve the state of food security in Karamoja. 

Potential questions for consideration are:
Which is the district/sub-county with lowest crop yield ?
How many districts/sub-counties should we prioritise?
Which is the district/sub-county with the highest population?

Other potential questions that can be investigated are:
Which crop has the highest yield?
Which is the district/sub-county with lowest crop production?
Which crop occupies the least area?
Which district/sub-county has the lowest ratio of unutilized land for crop growth?
This report seeks to answer the following qeustions.
